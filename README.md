# coms327hw103

This project generates the distance maps under the actual front end map. There are three maps generated: one for the rival, one for the hiker, and one for the other npc. 

To run the project: 
```$ make```
```$ ./poke327```

The program should run after that. First it will display the map generated in previous assignemnts. Then it will generate the different distance maps, and lastly it will prompt for a command from the user.
